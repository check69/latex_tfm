%Conclusion

After reading and summarizing all information I come to the following conclusions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Articles:} The majority of the articles refer to differents methodologies used to test IoT environments, however some articles propose some tools and certificates for IoT testing vulnerabilities. It is very interesting to know all the available methodologies and learn the tools for testing.
	
	\item \textbf{Companies:} I divided them in two groups, because I think that in order to protect IoT device it is important doing it in the two differents ways at the same time. But the main group that is really important for this project would be the secure companies.

	\item \textbf{Pen-testing:} For the proper making of this work I should keep learning from similar links of this section.
	
	\item \textbf{IoT Classification:} I think the biggest market and the most unprotected is smart house. because when a company get a new device, has the required resources to securite it.
\end{itemize}
