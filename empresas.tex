The majority of the companies that provides security for IoT, are focused on offer solutions only for bussiness, regardless if they have conected devices or if they are involved with the device lifecycle. This way, the companies has influence in their develop, discovering its vulnerabilities from code and testing.

The bussiness focused on \IoT security can be classified in two groups. 

\subsection{Router companies}

Seek the network security by avoiding that any outsider user can connect and enter to the devices(routers).

This business are classified in two groups:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Domestic field:} They care much about the image and communication of its business, trying to make the customer forget about the typical old image of routers and sell it as an object of decoration that aim the function of protect or give more powerful wifi without interruptions according to each case. The aesthetic design of the router becomes a fundamental aspect in this type of companies and they give less information about the technical characteristics of the product. They opt for a very visual and advertising approach, with promotional videos that families can quickly empathize with. They tend to sell speed and comfort, giving importance to the ease of use in many cases from a single device (usually have a mobile application to control everything from there). They also sell protection especially for children (parental control). It is clear that they want to reach parents who are concerned about the safety of their children and the electronic devices in their home. They often use close and direct messages with understandable language that arouses feelings of protection of home and family.
	
	\item \textbf{Business field:} They focus on giving a more serious and technical approach. They are less attractive visually and focus on giving technical information of what their products offer, almost like an anti-virus brand. In their website, they usually have a section where they tell stories of customers (companies, institutions, organizations, etc.) that use their services or products and all sectors where they operate. They offer a list with specific solutions for each case and usually add a section with a list of all the technical characteristics they meet (sometimes compared to other types of services). They do not want to evoke emotions in their messages as in the domestic oriented companies. We find a much more technical and informative language.

\subsection{Security companies} 

This companies seek to help with the development of a safe product and provide tools or personnel to check and change at any time any possible vulnerability.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\href{http://www.beyondsecurity.com}{Beyond security}}
	provides several testing solutions for assess and manage security weaknesses in networks, applications, industrial systems and networked software. They simplify the network management and application security in order to reduce attacks and data loss, meeting security policy requirements and industry and government standards. It is focused only to bussiness. 
	
	They have two products:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\href{http://www.beyondsecurity.com/avds.html}{AVDS}} Traditional VA/VM systems tend to be error-prone and can generate bloated, hard to use reports. AVDS with its zero false positive design will identify vulnerabilities with precision so that you can act with certainty to eliminate your network's most serious security weaknesses. At the same time you may discover that your network doesn't actually have many of the issues being reported by your current scanning solution.
		
		\item \textbf{\href{http://www.beyondsecurity.com/bestorm.html}{beSTORM}} is a commercial, black box, intelligent fuzzer. It is used in a lab environment to test application security during development or to certify software and networked hardware prior to deployment. It does dynamic security testing of products in development and can be used by network administrators to certify the security of networked applications before deployment. Software QA departments that may be using a dozen different tools to test application security can now get all dynamic security testing done with just one. Administrators who must certify applications before deployment can now use one tool to test all networked applications - even those with proprietary protocols. 		
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \href{https://www.praetorian.com/}{\textbf{Praetorian.com}} Offers solutions for clients to find, fix, stop, and ultimately solve cybersecurity problems across their entire enterprise and product portfolios.\\
